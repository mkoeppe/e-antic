E-ANTIC -- (Real Embedded) Algebraic Number Theory In C
=======================================================

e-Antic is a C/C++ library to deal with real embedded number fields built on
top of ANTIC (https://github.com/wbhart/antic). Its aim is to have as fast
as possible exact arithmetic operations and comparisons.

The library is currently under active development.

The dependencies are:

 - flint2 (see http://flintlib.org).
 - arb (see http://arblib.org/)
 - antic (see https://github.com/wbhart/antic/)

For now, we rely on the development version of the above libraries.

If you have cloned the source directory you will need to setup the
configure script and Makefile using autotools. That is

    $ autoreconf --install

If you obtained a tarball of the sources or if the preceding step
worked, you just have to do

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

If you happen to have flint, arb and antic installed in a non
standard directory you will have to specify the `CFLAGS`, `CPPFLAGS`
and `LDFLAGS` variables in the configure script

    $ ./configure CFLAGS=-I/my/path/include CPPFLAGS=-I/my/path/include LDFLAGS=-L/my/path/lib

For more detailed instructions read the INSTALL file.
